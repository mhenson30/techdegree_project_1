        <h2>Education and What led me to Web</h2>
        <p>I started out taking some classes with a Visual Communications program, a career technical program that combines web, print, and digital design, as well as offering classes in photography and filmmaking. As much as I loved that, my career was going a different direction. I decided to focus fully on web design, and joined Treehouse to pursue the Front End Web Development Techdegree.</p>
